            Men's NCAA college basketball's post-season tournament, often referred to as March Madness, is one of the biggest sporting events of the year, and as such is one of the most gambled upon events in Las Vegas (over $2.25 billion gambled on 2007 Final Four) <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/2007-03-27-gambling-cover_n.htm">(McCarthy 2007)</a>. Millions of bettors join a pool, in which they receive a varying amount of points per correctly guessing a team's victory in a certain round. As such, people try and determine the optimal manner in order to get the highest amount of points out of the 2 to the 64th options. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2018/03/architecting-live-ncaa-predictions-from-archives-to-insights">Even Google</a> is attempting to predict games for this year's tournament. <a href = "http://bracketodds.cs.illinois.edu/2009%20Journal%20of%20Gambling,%20Business,%20and%20Economics.pdf">Sheldon H. Jacobson</a> ran statistical analyses in 2009 on determining in which rounds a higher seed (the better ranked team) has a significant chance of winning more than half of its games in any particular round. The findings at that time showed two key items: the first is that higher seeds (1 - 3) won a majority of their games in the first 3 rounds, however, for the last three rounds the win/loss ratio of higher seeded teams became insignificant. 
	       To begin, this website will have updated statistics of Sheldon H. Jacobson's work through the 2018 tournament. The information needed to complete the statistics will be either obtained from <a href="https://developer.sportradar.com/files/indexBasketball.html?shell#ncaa-men-39-s-basketball-api-map">SportsRadar</a>, an API for basketball statistics, or through web-scraping the NCAA website using python scripts like <a href="https://pastebin.com/b3LtPx6p">this as a foundation</a>, depending on NCAA's web-scraping policy. The website would function as follows. Firstly, for non-users or guests, they would only be able to look at the final brackets of each year as well as the statistics for each seed like in <a href="http://bracketodds.cs.illinois.edu/2009%20Journal%20of%20Gambling,%20Business,%20and%20Economics.pdf">Table 2</a>. Next, users would be able to create randomized brackets based off the statistics for any year (including this year) and determine how many points they would have received for that bracket. Then, they can save their brackets for future use and reference. Administrators would be able to remove other user's brackets and update scores and statistics.
	For additional ideas, remember that statistically speaking after the third-round higher seeds do not win more than a majority of those games. To account for this, it may also be good to look at expert analysis data for prediction instead of just seed rankings. Some rankings that could be included would be <a href="https://kenpom.com/#">KenPom</a> and <a href="https://www.ncaa.com/rankings/basketball-men/d1/ncaa-mens-basketball-rpi">RPI</a>. Again, these would probably have to be obtained through web-scraping. So, referencing back to the users where they could create their own bracket based off of statistical data, they could also have the option to create a bracket based off either KenPom or RPI, or maybe a combination of them (higher seed probability for the first three rounds and then KenPom or RPI for the last three). Again, they would be able to compare these brackets to what their actual scores would have been. Lastly, it would also be interesting to do the same for the women's tournament.
	So, in conclusion, registered users would be able to randomly generate completed brackets for any year based off of different parameters (statistical, expert analysis, or a combination) and then be able to see what their point total would have been. With this, bettors will in theory be able to increase their odds in creating a winning bracket.
