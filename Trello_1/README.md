Jason Akers

Date began on Project: March 1st.

Hours spent: Lost count, 25+ish.

Toughest item to implement: task list....

References: Firebase Website, Duvall example Firebase code.

Problems remaining with this:
1. Have yet to implement CSS to make it Trello like.
2. Have yet to be able to display Task List.
3. Have yet to filter by categories and change colors.
4. Have yet to organize list/cards.
5. 3 challenges.
6. some fields will error out if box is empty havent implemented catches for all input fields.



IMPORTANT: V2 Additions and changes below:

Hours spent: add on additional 10.

Problems solved since V1:
1. Task List is now integrated.
2. Added categories and colors.
3. Implemented a little CSS to make it look Card like.

Items remaining, note that some may be repeated from V1:
1. Edit categories, want to make it such that if a category is deleted all of the cards with that category go to uncategorized.
2. Filter visibility based on category and date.
3. Changing which the list the card is under.
4. Ability to edit the card's name.
5. Currently images are url based, need it so that it is uploaded to Firebase Storage instead.
6. Editing the name of the list.
7. Rearranging order of the list.
8. Bootstrap and more CSS
9. Three challenges.
10. Have catches for in case a field already exists or a field is empty.

Current bugs:
1. Mainly to do with card category colors. Colors are not loaded up when page is loaded.
1a. When changing the category, sometimes have to double click before the color change will go into effect.
1b. If the new category of a card is the same as one above it, the color for the bottom one will not change.
