Errors: console will state an error when pressing next/submit answer due to a prop.

Functionality of quiz: Choose any quiz. When in quiz, select a radio then hit submit to submit the answer. If its wrong you can try again, if its correct you get moved to the next question if there is one. You can click next question to skip ahead and then previous question to return to an unanswered question. After all questions are answered, it will give you the number of correct answers out of the number of tries it actually took to complete the quiz. you then have the option to take any of the quizzes yet again.

Took approximately 17 hrs


Toughest sections: kept on wanting to use emit for the radio, also :value versus value in the radio input messed me up.
