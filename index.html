<h2>Computer Science Biography</h2>
    <p> I began using a computer when I was about six years old, back when dial-up was fast and AOL was popular. My first computer was a Dell desktop, running Windows XP. I then started using my parent's laptop, another Dell, running Windows 7. In 2013, I took the leap to a Macbook Pro Retina 15" and still use the computer. I use the computer frequently, whether it is using it for homework, programming for fun, watching shows, playing video games, etc. I believe that a computer scientist does problem solving, collaborates with others, does planning and brainstorming, and of course programs. I grew up playing a lot of video games and spent a lot of time on the computer, so just wanted to study something that I enjoyed. To code different parts of a website, need to have good collaboration skills, as well as knowledge of HTML, Javascript, and SQL. In the future, I plan on using computers in the same way as I currently do, just with more experience.</p>
