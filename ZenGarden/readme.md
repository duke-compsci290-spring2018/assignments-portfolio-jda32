In this folder, there are three seperate ZenGarden websites, all linked from my homepage. The first one is the one example given, called original page on ZenGardenHome.

The purpose of ZenGarden 1 was to experiment with columns. The first column that is split into two is supposed to become vertical (aka one on top of the other) once the screen size reaches a small enough size. Meanwhile, the columns at the bottom of the page are not supposed to readjust with differing screen sizes.

The purpose of ZenGarden 2 was to experiment with fixed sidebars, headers, and footers. There are supposed to be two sidebars fixed into position, one header fixed into position, and the footer is supposed to go over top of the bottom of the left sidebar. Meanwhile, the only part that is supposed to scroll is the main text in the middle of the webpage.
