This project was to create our own version of breakout.

The code is based off of Pong_with_classes.js that Duvall provided, and the file used for the project is pong_with_classes.js. There are three levels which determine the number of hits it takes to completely destroy a block. Movement is done by the arrow keys if the mouse is not on the canvas or the mouse, though arrow keys are preferred. Some powerups include reversing controls, changing speed of the ball, or just having an invisible brick. Last score is kept, and you get three lives. Use G to complete the game. Losing a life docks 5 points off of score.
