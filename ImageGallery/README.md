Began working on February 18th, finished on February 20th.

Took approximately 10-14 hrs.

Used some tutorials from W3 on code, mainly on the module and manual slideshow.

The page is supposed to:
    Cycle through a background banner at the top, while keeping text visible.
    Clicking on the checkboxes will add or remove that category to the image gallery and manual slideshow.
    Clicking on an image except for abstract brings up a module.
    Clicking on an image in the manual slideshow will bring up the module and deselect all other categories.
    
Note that currently there is a bug where in by selecting an image on the manual slideshow it removes the ability to pull up the module and deselect tool afterwards, so can only be done on a fresh reload.
